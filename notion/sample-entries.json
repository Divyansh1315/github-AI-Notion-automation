              "linkedin_post": "I turned a fragmented sales environment into a decision-ready analytics layer for a regional hardware business. Leadership needed clarity on revenue trends, market concentration, and product-level profitability to prioritize inventory and go-to-market efforts. I approached the problem by translating business questions into repeatable analytics: consolidated raw tables into views, encoded business logic into stored procedures and user-defined functions, and delivered exportable datasets for pivot-driven dashboards. The work kept decision-making front and center — queries were structured to answer who, where, and when so stakeholders could act, not just observe. I leaned on MySQL for scalable transformations and Excel for rapid, presentation-ready analysis, balancing automation with explainability. The project sharpened my judgment on structuring analytics for operational use — especially when balancing query performance and stakeholder interpretability. Outcome: clearer market-level revenue signals, identified concentration risks, and a reusable reporting layer that cut ad-hoc reporting overhead and improved speed to insight. Happy to discuss how I translated business priorities into analytics hygiene and faster decisions.",
