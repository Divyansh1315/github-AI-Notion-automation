I wanted to understand how to position technical work in business terms...\n\nThis project solves the problem of under-communicated technical value by transforming raw GitHub READMEs into recruiter-ready content.\n\nInstead of listing tools, the workflow emphasizes problem framing, decision impact, and professional growth.\n\nBy combining API orchestration, structured AI generation, and schema enforcement, I created a repeatable content engine that converts documentation into career assets.\n\nThe result is not just automation — it’s systemized positioning.\n\nCurious how you communicate the impact of your projects?",
