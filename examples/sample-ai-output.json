  "linkedin_post": "Most developers build projects. Few position them strategically.\n\nThis project addresses a common gap: technical work often lacks business framing. Instead of merely documenting features, I designed an automation pipeline that converts raw GitHub READMEs into recruiter-ready narratives.\n\nThe system ingests documentation, cleans unstructured text, and applies schema-enforced AI generation to produce structured content across LinkedIn, Twitter, resumes, and portfolio summaries.\n\nRather than listing tools, the approach emphasizes problem framing, decision impact, and analytical thinking.\n\nBy integrating API orchestration, data transformation, and structured prompt engineering, I created a repeatable positioning engine.\n\nThe result is not just automation — it’s a scalable method to convert technical work into professional capital.\n\nHow do you currently communicate the business value behind your projects?",
